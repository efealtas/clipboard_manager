# Clipboard Manager

An offline, cross-platform clipboard manager desktop app built with Flutter Desktop. The app automatically logs copied text snippets, allows searching and tagging, and saves data locally using SQLite. It features a clean and responsive UI with dark and light themes that persist across app launches.

### How It Works

The app listens for clipboard changes and saves new text snippets to a local SQLite database. 
The UI allows users to view their clipboard history, search entries. 
The theme toggle button switches the app between dark and light modes, saving the preference locally so that the chosen theme is applied every time the app launches.
