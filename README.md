### How It Works

The app listens for clipboard changes and saves new text snippets to a local SQLite database. 
The UI allows users to view their clipboard history, search entries. 
The theme toggle button switches the app between dark and light modes, saving the preference locally so that the chosen theme is applied every time the app launches.
